# Artificial-Neural-Networks

In this project, I used an artificial neural network to predict the customer retention rate of a bank!

An executable .py file can be found for the model, along with a .ipynb file to visualize the model's results on the dataset. Additionally, the dataset is attached.

This project was completed through a course on Udemy in July 2023 but was only added to GitHub recently.
